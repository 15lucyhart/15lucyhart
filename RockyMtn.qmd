## Background

Rocky Mountain Ski and Sport (RMSS) is a locally owned ski and snowboard shop based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The shop was founded with a mission to make winter sports more accessible, more sustainable, and more community centered. Instead of encouraging constant gear replacement, RMSS focuses on repairing equipment, extending product lifecycles, and promoting the use of high-quality used gear.

RMSS specializes in:

- High-quality used skis, snowboards, boots, and bindings  
- Professional tuning and repairs to extend equipment life  
- Safe fittings for riders of all experience levels  
- Packaging online orders using reused and recycled materials  
- Providing budget-friendly gear for families, beginners, and experienced riders  
- Educating the community through in-store expertise and social media content  

This combination of sustainability, affordability, and knowledge has made RMSS a trusted resource for skiers and snowboarders across the Colorado Springs and Pueblo region.

## How Rocky Mountain Ski and Sport Reduces Waste in the Ski Industry

### **Repairing Existing Gear**
RMSS performs waxes, tunes, edge sharpening, P-tex repairs, and full safety checks. These repairs keep skis and snowboards riding longer, reducing the need for new manufacturing and minimizing equipment waste.

### **Reselling Quality Used Equipment**
Buying used gear keeps equipment out of landfills, cuts down on emissions tied to production, and makes snow sports accessible to more people. Every used item is inspected, refurbished, and tuned so customers get safe, high-quality gear at a fraction of the cost.

### **Reusing and Recycling Packaging**
From shipping boxes to bubble wrap, RMSS prioritizes reusing and recycling all packing materials. This reduces the environmental footprint of online orders and models sustainable business practices for the ski community.

These videos help customers make informed decisions and strengthen the shop’s role as a community resource.

- Package orders using recycled and reused materials  
- Ship equipment nationwide with reliable turnaround times

- Ensure that every customer gets accurate, helpful guidance even from afar  

This role helps expand RMSS’s reach while reinforcing the shop’s sustainability goals.
