    "section": "Featured Article: Sustainable Skiing and Snowboarding in the Fountain Creek Watershed",
    "text": "Featured Article: Sustainable Skiing and Snowboarding in the Fountain Creek Watershed\nWinter in Colorado pulls people outside, but it also gives us a chance to think about how our choices impact the watershed we live in. While skiing and snowboarding are winter favorites, it is important to understand the environmental impact it holds. Skiing and snowboarding can be high-impact sports when it comes to waste, transportation, and the strain on mountain environments. With a few intentional choices, we can enjoy the season while keeping our footprint lighter and staying connected to the water systems that support our communities.\nOne of the biggest steps toward more sustainable winter recreation is choosing quality gear that lasts. Ski and snowboard equipment takes a lot of resources to make, and most riders replace it long before it is truly worn out. Rocky Mountain Ski and Sport in Colorado Springs is a great local example of how to break that cycle. Instead of pushing new gear every season, they specialize in repairing equipment, tuning old boards and skis, using recycled materials, and reselling quality used gear. This keeps equipment out of landfills, makes the sport more affordable and accessible, and reduces the demand for constant manufacturing.\nHow we get to the slopes is another major factor that leads to emissions. Traffic on winter weekends means more emissions, more road salt runoff, and more impact on the mountain environments where our snowpack eventually becomes the water that feeds the Fountain Creek system. Shared travel is one of the easiest ways to cut that impact. Rocky Mountain Ride offers ski shuttles from downtown Colorado Springs to Monarch, Breckenridge, Keystone, and Arapahoe Basin. They leave from downtown Colorado Springs at 6:30 a.m. and depart from the resort at 3:00 p.m. on select days and make the trip without adding dozens of individual cars to the road. It is also easy to organize carpools from Colorado Springs or Pueblo, which reduces both fuel use and parking pressure at the resorts.\nNot every winter adventure has to be a resort trip. Cross country skiing and snowshoeing close to home can be just as rewarding and often have the lowest impact. Trails near water sources help people see the connection between winter recreation and the watershed. Woodmoor Nordic in Monument is a local groomed option, offering classic and skate ski trails supported by a nonprofit that keeps access affordable. There are also several cross country and snowshoe trails in the Colorado Springs and Pueblo areas listed on TrailLink, a website that catalogs walking, hiking, biking, and cross-country ski trails around the country. For a more direct link to local water systems, winter trails around spots like Rampart Reservoir give people a chance to experience snowpack right at the source of our future water supply.\nSustainable winter recreation doesn’t have to be complicated. Repairing and reusing gear, choosing shared transportation, and exploring nearby trails all help protect the watershed while keeping winter recreation fun and accessible. Each of these choices reduces waste, lowers emissions, and supports the long-term health of the landscapes that make winter in Colorado worth celebrating."
