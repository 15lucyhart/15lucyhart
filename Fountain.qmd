## About the Fountain Creek Watershed

The Fountain Creek Watershed stretches from the Palmer Divide south through Colorado Springs to where Fountain Creek meets the Arkansas River in Pueblo. It covers about 927 square miles and includes urban areas, open spaces, creeks, wetlands, and important wildlife habitat.

Because so many communities share this creek system, what happens upstream affects people, water quality, and ecosystems downstream. Flooding, erosion, stormwater runoff, and pollution can all travel through the watershed and impact neighborhoods, farms, parks, and recreation areas in both El Paso and Pueblo Counties.

## What the Fountain Creek Watershed District Does

The Fountain Creek Watershed, Flood Control and Greenway District (often shortened to the Fountain Creek Watershed District) was created in 2009 as a special district to protect and improve the health of the watershed.

The District’s main goals include:

-   Reducing flood risk by improving drainage, restoring floodplains, and managing stormwater
-   Limiting erosion and sediment so creek channels and banks stay more stable
-   Improving water quality for people, wildlife, and recreation
-   Protecting open space and riparian corridors along Fountain Creek and its tributaries
-   Creating and supporting trails, parks, and public access along the creek

To do this, the District works with cities, counties, state and federal agencies, nonprofits, and local residents. Projects can include creek bank stabilization, wetland and riparian restoration, trail connections, green infrastructure, and public education.

## My Role with the Fountain Creek Watershed District

I support the District through outreach writing and storytelling. My work focuses on helping people understand the connection between everyday choices and the health of the Fountain Creek Watershed.

In practice, that means:

-   Writing seasonal articles that highlight local recreation options, sustainability practices, and watershed-friendly choices
-   Connecting topics like winter sports, transportation, and outdoor recreation back to water, snowpack, and local ecosystems
-   Helping make watershed science and policy feel more relatable for people in Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and nearby communities

Below is an example of one of my recent articles, written for the District.

## Featured Article: Sustainable Skiing and Snowboarding in the Fountain Creek Watershed

Winter in Colorado pulls people outside, but it also gives us a chance to think about how our choices impact the watershed we live in. While skiing and snowboarding are winter favorites, it is important to understand the environmental impact it holds. Skiing and snowboarding can be high-impact sports when it comes to waste, transportation, and the strain on mountain environments. With a few intentional choices, we can enjoy the season while keeping our footprint lighter and staying connected to the water systems that support our communities.

One of the biggest steps toward more sustainable winter recreation is choosing quality gear that lasts. Ski and snowboard equipment takes a lot of resources to make, and most riders replace it long before it is truly worn out. Rocky Mountain Ski and Sport in Colorado Springs is a great local example of how to break that cycle. Instead of pushing new gear every season, they specialize in repairing equipment, tuning old boards and skis, using recycled materials, and reselling quality used gear. This keeps equipment out of landfills, makes the sport more affordable and accessible, and reduces the demand for constant manufacturing.

How we get to the slopes is another major factor that leads to emissions. Traffic on winter weekends means more emissions, more road salt runoff, and more impact on the mountain environments where our snowpack eventually becomes the water that feeds the Fountain Creek system. Shared travel is one of the easiest ways to cut that impact. Rocky Mountain Ride offers ski shuttles from downtown Colorado Springs to Monarch, Breckenridge, Keystone, and Arapahoe Basin. They leave from downtown Colorado Springs at 6:30 a.m. and depart from the resort at 3:00 p.m. on select days and make the trip without adding dozens of individual cars to the road. It is also easy to organize carpools from Colorado Springs or Pueblo, which reduces both fuel use and parking pressure at the resorts.

Not every winter adventure has to be a resort trip. Cross country skiing and snowshoeing close to home can be just as rewarding and often have the lowest impact. Trails near water sources help people see the connection between winter recreation and the watershed. Woodmoor Nordic in Monument is a local groomed option, offering classic and skate ski trails supported by a nonprofit that keeps access affordable. There are also several cross country and snowshoe trails in the Colorado Springs and Pueblo areas listed on TrailLink, a website that catalogs walking, hiking, biking, and cross-country ski trails around the country. For a more direct link to local water systems, winter trails around spots like Rampart Reservoir give people a chance to experience snowpack right at the source of our future water supply.

Sustainable winter recreation doesn’t have to be complicated. Repairing and reusing gear, choosing shared transportation, and exploring nearby trails all help protect the watershed while keeping winter recreation fun and accessible. Each of these choices reduces waste, lowers emissions, and supports the long-term health of the landscapes that make winter in Colorado worth celebrating.
