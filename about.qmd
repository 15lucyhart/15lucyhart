Hi! My name is Lucy Hart and I am a student in the Professional Science Master's in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability program.

I love exploring the outdoors, playing soccer, snowboarding, running, hiking, and traveling.

I am a salesperson and the marketing lead at a ski and snowboard shop in Colorado Springs.
