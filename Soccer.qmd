## My Division I Soccer Journey

Soccer has been one of the most defining parts of my life. I played NCAA Division I soccer for four years, and those years shaped me as an athlete, a leader, a teammate, and a person. When I committed to play at the collegiate level, I moved to a state where I didn’t know anyone; no friends, no family nearby, and everything completely new. That decision ended up giving me a community that felt like home.

My team was made up of players from all over the world, which meant every practice, bus ride, and meal introduced me to new cultures, new perspectives, and even new languages. Those teammates became lifelong friends, and the experience opened my world far beyond the field.

I played my first two seasons at the University of Northern Colorado and my following two seasons at Texas State University. I would not trade that experience for anything. It was an amazing four years.

## Competitive Success

Throughout my four-year career, I was a **consistent starter**, trusted in high-pressure situations and relied on by my coaches and teammates. My performance earned:

-   **Two All-Conference selections**\
-   **Two Academic All-District honors**\
-   **Four years of being in the starting lineup**

My senior year, we made a run to the **conference finals**, a moment that represented years of hard work, sacrifice, and team evolution. Competing at that level taught me how to stay composed, disciplined, and focused under pressure, both on and off the field.

## What Soccer Taught Me

Playing Division I soccer didn’t just make me a better athlete — it built the foundation for many of my personal and professional strengths today:

### **Leadership**

I learned how to communicate clearly, support teammates, adapt during adversity, and lead by example. Whether it was guiding younger players, staying composed during intense matches, or being a voice on the field, leadership became a natural part of who I am.

### **Teamwork**

Soccer is built on trust. You win together, lose together, and push each other every day. Learning how to work with players from different cultures, backgrounds, and playing styles strengthened my ability to collaborate with anyone.

### **Resilience**

Balancing academics, athletics, travel, early morning practices, and constant expectations taught me discipline and mental toughness that transfer into every part of my life.

### **Opportunities and Connections**

Through soccer, I met coaches, staff, alumni, and professionals who have become mentors and lifelong connections. These relationships have opened doors for future opportunities — including the next one.

## Looking Ahead: A Professional Opportunity

My journey didn’t end with my final collegiate match. I now have the opportunity to continue playing at the **professional level**, something that younger me could have only dreamed of. Continuing to grow, compete, and represent myself at a higher level is an exciting next step in my soccer career.
