## My Snowboarding Journey  

I am currently in my fourth season of snowboarding, and it has become one of the most meaningful parts of my life. Winter sports have always felt grounding to me. They create a sense of freedom, confidence, and calm that is difficult to find anywhere else. For me, snowboarding is more than a hobby — it is a tool for mental health, resilience, and joy.

Riding in the mountains gives me clarity, especially during stressful or busy seasons of life. The focus, the cold air, the physical challenge, and the feeling of progression all help reset my mind. Snowboarding pushes me to stay centered, motivated, and connected to the outdoors.

## Passion for Accessibility in Winter Sports

One of my biggest goals is to help make skiing and snowboarding more accessible. Too often, winter sports are viewed as something only the wealthy can participate in. High prices for gear, lift tickets, and travel create real barriers for many people who want to try something new or experience the mountains.

Through my work in the ski industry, and especially at Rocky Mountain Ski and Sport, I am passionate about:

- Expanding access to quality used gear  
- Teaching people about affordable alternatives  
- Reducing waste and lowering gear costs through repair and reuse  
- Creating a more welcoming, inclusive culture in winter sports  
- Encouraging more beginners, families, and young riders to enter the sport  

Everyone deserves the chance to experience the confidence, community, and joy that snowboarding brings — not just those who can afford high-end equipment or resort prices.

## Snowboarding and Mental Health

Snowboarding has helped me stay grounded in difficult times and has become a powerful outlet for managing stress and staying active. It supports mental health by:

- Providing a physical challenge that builds confidence  
- Encouraging mindfulness and presence on the mountain  
- Reconnecting people with nature and seasonal cycles  
- Building a community of supportive, like-minded riders  
- Giving people something joyful and motivating during winter months  

For many riders, including me, snowboarding is a form of therapy — one built on movement, nature, and progression.

## Looking Ahead

Snowboarding is something I want to continue growing in — not just as a rider, but as someone who helps others access the sport. Whether through education, sustainable gear practices, or community outreach, I hope to make winter sports more inclusive, more affordable, and more mentally supportive for everyone.
